# soundstone [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/galaxgames/soundstone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/galaxgames/soundstone)
Soundstone is an audio mixer and processor for use in real-time applications. It uses Mozilla's wonderful cubeb library for audio output.

## Features
* Implemented in c++11. Utilizes cool c++11 features like move semantics and threading
* Capable of multithreaded audio processing and mixing
* Easy to integrate with video games and other real-time applications.

## How do I build it?
soundstone is built with cmake and optionally uses dew, my dependency manager, to manage dependencies. See [giygas's](https://github.com/galaxgames/giygas) readme for information on using these two tools.

## Oh boy I can't wait to use this library with my AAA video game and/or mission critical software!
That's great! There's _totally_ no issues in this library. It's _super solid_ and is used by _soooo many people_! There's _no way_ _anyone_ could possibly encounter an issue with this library.

## I found something broken. Can I report it / fix it?
Please do! GitHub issues and pull requests are extremely welcome.
